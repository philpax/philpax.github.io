- Slang
  - originally a NVIDIA initiative, but donated to Khronos in 2024
  - in a way, superset of WGSL/WESL/Naga
  - programming language for the GPU, but also the compiler for that language
- So why Slang?
  - Open-source, open-governance
  - Write your shader once, runs everywhere
  - Supports both compute and rendering
  - Not limited by the lowest-common-denominator, like WebGPU
  - Autodiff built in, but Crozet hasn't used it; could be useful for traning
  - Most importantly, it has modern syntax; so much nicer than WGSL or GLSL
  - Supports reflection; can ask the compiler for information about your shaders. Can have the compiler allocate binding sets, and then ask the compiler how it was done
  - See Khronos's BOF presentation at SIGGRAPH 2025: <https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/presentations/Slang_BOF_SIGGRAPH_2025.pdf>
- Using Slang in Rust
  - The compiler is written in C++, but there are Rust bindings
  - Crozet wrote a small wrapper (`minislang`) to make it nicer to work with
  - Need to write a RHI (rendering hardware interface?) to translate Slang's commands to each graphics API - `slang-hal` - only for the GPU API, not for the shaders
  - Utilities/libraries built atop slang:
    - `stensor` for tensor manipulation - new library because he needs these operations to be reusable from other domains
    - `slai` - physics simulations etc
- Slang in action
  - Structured buffers are not global variables, like they are in other shading languages, but actual arguments to kernels; makes it easier to maintain
  - Slang has a built-in module system, so you don't need a preprocessor or anything like that; can reuse code across your codebase or other libraries
  - Write kernel launch - no binding groups, no backend choice - it's all handled for you
- `slai`: dimforge is working on Slang AI
  - Very incomplete right now, still in the experimentation phase
  - Have implemented Gemma + Whisper model
  - See `wgml` for a purely WebGPU implementation
- What's next?
  - Still targeting the single-source GPU scientific computing dream
  - Close to ideal, but no package manager, no CPU/GPU code sharing, incomplete IDE support
  - Last experiment; Rust-GPU, more at the end of the year
  - Also have a focus on generating datasets for AI stuff using GPU-based phyics simulations
- Question: Does it have support for generics?
  - `[wasn't paying attention]`
- Question: Game engine integration?
  - Theoretically possible, just need to be careful about staying in the same API
  - Bevy is exclusively WebGPU; Slang could generate the WGSL, and use them directly
