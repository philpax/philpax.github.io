- VR Hardware and Tracking Systems
  - VR started in 1968 with Ivan Sutherland's work, but this was basically useless in comparison
  - 2012: Oculus Rift DK1
    - Small, affordable
    - IMU-only; can track rotation/acceleration, no position
  - Tracking sytsems
    - LED ("Constellation")
      - Started with Oculus Rift DK2
      - Known pattern of LEDs on headset
      - Using a infrared webcam
      - Computer vision matching LED pattern to 3D pose
      - Using camera calibration to get exact poses
    - Lighthouse
      - No cameras
      - Lighthouses that sweep room with lasers
      - Sensors on the headset then register time of sweep hitting
      - Match timestamps to 3D pose
    - SLAM
      - Introduced by Windows Mixed reality
      - Cameras built into headset, no fixed external reference
      - Using computer vision to find and track features across the field of view
  - LED tracking systems have largely fallen out of favour, but they're still used for controllers by SLAM headsets
  - Standalone headsets
    - Typically bootloader locked
    - Lynx R-1 supports mainline Linux porting effort
    - Steam Frame?
- In 2013, the OpenHMD project was started
  - Now mostly unmaintained
- OSVR
  - HDK headset by Razer
  - SDK by Sensics
  - Sensic ceased operations in 2019
  - OSVR mostly unmaintained
- Monado
  - Finally a push to unify APIs in 2018
  - Trying to build Mesa for OpenXR
  - Lots of drivers for lots of hardware
- Monado supports all three tracking systems to varying success
  - LED tracking
    - Supports PSVR/PS Move, shipped by iVRy, but no further development
    - Rift DK2/CV1/controllers, started by thaytan, ongoing work
  - Lighthouse
    - Open-source library `libsurvive`, but not fully complete, and on maintenance mode by Collabora
    - Using closed-source `steamvr_lh` wrapper by most people
  - SLAM
    - Basalt is CPU-heavy, tracking quality is not quite commercial level
    - New SLAM frameworks are always coming out, some open-source
    - Quick demo of the SLAM system with a headset
- Hand-tracking implementation
  - Stereo cameras
  - onnx model trained on open + synthetic data
- Monado can be ported to standalone headsets
  - GNU/Linux: Linux headsets
  - Android: Currently 3DoF-only, SLAM/additional tracking required
- Contributing
  - Talk to the team/community before anything
  - GitLab + Matrix/Discord (bridged) + IRC (not particularly used)
- Future:
  - MR/AR/perception
  - Plane/object detection
  - Environment depth estimation
  - Mesh environment reconstruction
  - Semantic labelling
  - AI commodisation should make it possible to support all of this perception tech
- Desktop:
  - xrdesktop
  - WayVR
  - Stardust XR
  - Simula VR
- OSXR ecosystem:
  - Godot, LOVR, osgXR, StereoKit, Bevy
  - ParaView, Blender, FreeCad
- Web ecosystem is worse:
  - Firefox is OpenVR-only, Windows-only, no current XR effort
  - Chrome doesn't want to ship OpenXR Linux support
  - WebKit is being worked on by Igalia
  - Servo doesn't support WebXR on Linux yet
  - Android based with Lepton: Wolvic, maybe?
