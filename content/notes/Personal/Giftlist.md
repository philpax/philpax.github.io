I have been traditionally quite difficult to buy gifts for; I usually buy what I want for myself, and the things I don't buy are too expensive for anyone to reasonably afford.

With that being said, I am still collating this list so that I know what _I_ want, and for anyone suitably silly with it to be aware. It is incomplete and messy; I'll update it as time passes.

<!-- more -->

The number one thing I want is _time_, but that, unfortunately, cannot be bought. If you have a hookup for a hyperbolic time chamber or the box from Primer, let me know!

Don't put "Philpax is a figurine guy" in the newspaper. I just think this particular one is neat; I love its composition and how well-framed it is.

# VR headsets

One of:

- [Bigscreen Beyond 2e VRChat Edition](https://store.bigscreenvr.com/products/bigscreen-beyond-2)
- [Shiftall MeganeX 8K Superlight](https://en.shiftall.net/products/meganex8k)
- [Pimax Dream Air](https://pimax.com/pages/dream-air)

# Media

- [My Steam wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Philpax/)
- Switch games (honestly, I'd buy these on Steam, but these editions appear to be Switch exclusives):
  - [The House in Fata Morgana: Dreams of the Revenants Edition](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-house-in-fata-morgana-dreams-of-the-revenants-edition-switch/)
  - [TSUKIHIME -A piece of blue glass moon-](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tsukihime-a-piece-of-blue-glass-moon-switch/)

# Hardware

## General

- a record player of some quality; need to do more research on this
- a decent gaming laptop with all-AMD so it has a higher chance of working with Linux
- Switch 2
- a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon 3D printer, or equivalent in quality, polish, and just-work-ism

## PC

- RTX 5090 or equivalent. Preferably NVIDIA for their ML features.
- good speakers, preferably with a subwoofer

## Server

- another 3090 or 4090. I have two 3090s in there, but more GPUs means more VRAM and more model parallelisation.
- 3x 24+TB hard drives. I need to set up ZFS sooner rather than later.

# Misc

- I need Fuji X-mount zoom lenses with autofocus. In order of priority:
  - [Fujinon XF16-55mm F2.8 R LM WR](https://www.fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xf16-55mmf28-r-lm-wr/)
  - [Fujinon XF50-140mm F2.8 R LM OIS WR](https://www.fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xf50-140mmf28-r-lm-ois-wr/)
  - [Fujinon XF70-300mm F4-5.6 R LM OIS WR](https://www.fujifilm-x.com/global/products/lenses/xf70-300mmf4-56-r-lm-ois-wr/)
