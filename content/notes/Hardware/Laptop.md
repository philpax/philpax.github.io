My current laptop is a mildly-upgraded Lenovo ThinkPad T480s (2018) running NixOS. It's certainly not the newest or the fastest, but it does the job, and it's pretty comfy to use. Love the ThinkPad-isms of it, too: the dedicated mouse buttons + the nub are simply a delight.

My previous personal laptop was an Australian rebrand of the Eluktronics Mech-15 G3 (2021), which has a better-known rebrand as the XMG NEO 15 2021. Unfortunately, it stopped booting some time ago, which I can only assume was from constantly being on 24/7 for several years straight.
