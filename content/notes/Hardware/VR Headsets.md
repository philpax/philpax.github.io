This is a coarse list of the VR headsets I own. Collecting them is a hobby of mine, but I can't say that I actually use anything but the Quest 3 and Index on a regular basis.

I'd like to write a proper review of each and/or compare them (especially a comparison of the Pico 4/Lynx R-1/Quest 3/Vision Pro), but who has the time for that?

| _2023_      | Meta             | Quest 3     | My main VR headset. VRChat-via-Virtual-Desktop and portable use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| _2019_      | Valve            | Index       | My secondary VR headset. Beat Saber, higher-fidelity socialising in VRChat.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| _?_         | SimulaVR         | Simula One  | First one to buy in. I believe in the Linux XR computing dream, but I suspect this will be quite outdated by the time it finally ships. Still, looking forward to it.                                                                                                                |
| _2024_      | Apple            | Vision Pro  | Man. It's cool as hell, but there's nothing to actually _do_ on it other than watching movies. I am somehow partially optically incompatible with it, so I can't even use it for work.<br><br>It is a compromised devkit for a future headset that might actually be useful.         |
| _2023-2024_ | Lynx             | R-1         | A "open" standalone headset. I was a Kickstarter backer and run the unofficial Discord server for it, which is why I have both a pre-production and production unit.<br/></br>I have _opinions_ about it, and while I wish Lynx the best, I cannot recommend this headset to anyone. |
| _2022_      | Pico             | 4           | A marked upgrade over the Quest 2, but not much point when you have a Quest 3. More comfortable out of the box, though, due to its balanced weight.                                                                                                                                  |
| _2020_      | Meta             | Quest 2     | First standalone headset. I had good times with it, but man, it sure is a brick.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| _2016_      | HTC              | Vive        | My first SteamVR headset. Build quality was awful, but it showed me the way of room-scale VR.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| _2014_      | Oculus           | Rift DK2    | My first VR headset. See [my review](/blog/ocufabulous/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
