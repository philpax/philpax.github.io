- Latest news on the OpenXR side of things
- Updates on what Collabora is doing with Monado
- Collabora:
  - Main maintainers of OpenXR
  - Working with Khronos for many years
  - Making FOSS work for Fortune 500 customers for 20 years
- Spatial entities, extensions:
  - Persistent points in physical spaces
  - Basis for scene understanding and spatial reasoning
  - Standardised tracking for QR/Aruco/April codes
  - Discover and correlate entities across sessions
  - Util extensions for persisting and unpersisting
  - Identifying planes with semantics (wall, table, etc)
- Multi-app
  - Being worked on extensively
  - Not published
  - Have multiple apps interact spatially, and render correctly againts each other (occlusion, cross-lighting, etc)
  - MR games + desktop tools
- Best-practices validation layers
  - Best-practices validation layer for problematic API usage
  - Technically valid, but suboptimal patterns that cause performance/cross-runtim eissues
  - Early warnings during development
  - Improving portability + runtime consistency across XR platforms
  - Helps developers create more robust XR apps
- Tutorial project
  - Step-by-step guide for building an OpenXR app from setup to advanced features
  - Practical instructions, sample code, downloadable examples
  - Core topics: instance/session creation, graphics integration, input/interactions/extensions
  - Teaching OpenXR fundamentals
- OpenXR compliance boundary only covers the OpenXR API + implementations - _not game engines_
- Adding more transparency
  - Putting together matrices: Runtime Support Matrix and Client Support Matrix/Middleware Support Matrix
- Monado is the first fully-conformant open-source OpenXR implementation
  - Across all three platforms
  - It's a XR laboratory that allows you to test code without vendor black boxes/high costs
  - Headset makers can use it to enable thei rhardware
  - It's also accessible for academic research
- Monado 25.1.0
  - Async for non-blocking spatial queries
  - Hand-tracking data support
  - Native Linux drivers for Pico 4 Ultra / Xreal Air 2 Ultra
  - Google Cardboard capture
- Godot
  - Native Vulkan renderer optimiesd for low-latency
  - In-headset engine for edit+build entirely within VR
  - Integration funded by Khronos
  - Improves consistency, implements spatial entities, a bunch of other cool things
- LOVR
  - More features, including new render models
  - Nvidia CloudXR support
  - More recent OpenXR feature support coming
  - Maintainer has also joined Khronos
- StereoKit
- Contact Collabora if you're working on cool hardware or want a job
- Question: What is the process to update the matrix?
  - Runtime is run against the validation tests
  - Middleware is self-report, good-faith, not checked
- Question: Can users check for compliance of their software against a device?
  - No easy way without a device rn
