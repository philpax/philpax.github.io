<!-- more -->

- Can run build commands
- Framework to build your own build systems
- Can define your objects and let blueknow what to do
- Why another build system?
  - Blue is minimalist and self-contained
  - Only one dependency; guile
  - Blue can bootstrap itself
  - Blue is goal-based; you specify a goal and blue will figure out what steps are required
  - Blue is extensible
    - GOOPS: method overriding/redefining, inheritance
    - User-defined commands that can override built-in commands
    - Plugin system
    - Stencil system
    - Project serialisation
- Hello blue:
  - Blueprint for gathering a blue project description
  - Stencil for a set of buildable types and utilities to simplify the description of common patterns
  - Buildables for an object that blue knows how to build
  - Put this together into a blueprint
- This fails to begin with, because we need to provide a configuration for this stencil
  - Doing `blue configure -- build`
  - The double-dash is used to pass arguments to subcommands, like guix
- Configuration:
  - Can define variables for project - version, cflags, etc
  - Project dependencies - can use list mapping to construct it
  - Blue can tell you why thing sfail
  - Example:
    - Start by bringing blue modules
      - Add a C stencil
    - Add CFLAGS variable
    - Add the rest of the state
    - Configure and build
- Delayed computation
  - Expression evaluated at runtime with a dynamic computation environment
  - The application is memoized
  - Expression syntax for doing thisi
  - Syntax sugar for make-computation + lambda
  - Can be used for obtaining configuration values
  - Much more than variable expression; bring the power of Guile, and can be serialised to disk
- Replay functionality to debug how the build failed
- Preference system; can be defined globally, project-locally, or env variable
- Extensibility
  - Inheritance
  - Slots have a type system
  - Method overloading
  - Can define our own buildables
- BLUE.EL - emacs interface for BLUE
- BLUE can bootstrap by pulling itself in as a dependency
- Currently in the pre-alpha phase
- Lots of current features
