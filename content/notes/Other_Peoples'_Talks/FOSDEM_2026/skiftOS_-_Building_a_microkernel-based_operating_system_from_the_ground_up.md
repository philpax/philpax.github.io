- cutekit
  - Responsible for building; provides machinery for everything
- karm
  - Freestanding core shared between all components of the OS
  - Inspired by Rust/Go/C# stdlibs
  - Split into two components:
    - Freestanding: doesn't rely on any OS
    - Relies onto an OS
  - Written in Karm-flavoured C++
    - C with lambda, modules, and coroutines
    - No exceptions
    - Rust-like monadic error handling
    - String Clang safety checks - clamped lifetime bounds, etc
    - Unsafe buffer usage checks
  - Entrypoint is async, using C++ modules; hello world example presents a UI
    - Inspired by SwiftUI / Jetpack Compose
  - RPC
    - No IDL, using C++ structures
    - Using C++ reflection capabilities to generate code around the structures
- Bootloader: opstart
  - Simple EFI bootloader, like systemd-boot
  - Has its own boot protocol, called handover, basically a mmap with some attributes
  - Uses the same UI library as the rest of the OS
- Hjert microkernel
  - Pragmatic; not academically pure
  - 4k lines of code, minimalistic
  - Handles or ekernel responsibilities, IPC, minimal object model, etc
  - 25 syscalls
  - Syscall implementation
    - Wrapper for userspace memory that cannot be accessed until unwrapped with a `with` function
- Strata services
  - Strata component manager is loaded by Hjert as the first process
  - strata-cm then starts strata-init, which then launches sevices
  - strata-device (all device drivers, might be changed later), strata-fs, strata-inputs (HID), strata-shell
  - Applications running on top of all o fthis
- Hideo desktop
  - Custom display protocol; kind of like Wayland, but much simpler
  - Adaptive UI - can scale from a smartphone to a desktop
  - Vector based
  - Subpixel antialiasing
  - Truetype
- Skift has its own browser engine, Vael
  - Not really part of Skift
  - HTML/CSS only, no JS
  - Pretty fast
- Demo: cutekit to boot a QEMU VM
  - Looks pretty full-featured
  - Browser can render a few real websites, or snapshots of them, at least snapshots of them
  - Can run DOOM
  - No GPU acceleration
  - Audio is supported in karm, but not in skift itself
- Because the browser is built atop karm, and karm can run in the bootloader... it is possible to run the browser in the bootloader
- Beyond:
  - virtio support
  - networking
  - on-disk filesystem
  - sound server
  - namespacing
- Question: What architectures does it run on?
  - x86, RISC-V in the future
- Question: Real hardware?
  - It could, but it would be missing peripherals and other things
- Question: Custom window protocol - clientside rendering?
  - Yes. See Doom doesn't have any window decoration
- Question: What security mechanisms does your microkernel support?
  - Only from page-isolated processes
  - Each task has a limited domain
- Question: Does the UI library run on Linux?
  - Yes!
